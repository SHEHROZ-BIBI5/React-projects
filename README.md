# 🌸 React Projects Collection by Shehroz Bibi

Welcome to my **React.js Projects Repository** — a collection of all the projects I created while learning, experimenting, and growing as a **Full Stack Web Developer** 💻

Each project in this repo represents a small chapter of my coding journey — from my very first React component to dynamic web apps using React Router, props, and custom components.

## 🪶 About Me
Hi, I'm **Shehroz Bibi**, a self-taught **Full Stack Web Developer** passionate about learning, building, and exploring modern web technologies.

I started my programming journey on **3rd October 2024**, knowing nothing about coding —  
but with dedication, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and then fell in love with **React.js** ❤️  

I believe in learning by doing — that’s why I built every project here **from scratch**.
